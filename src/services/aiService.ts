  "simplified_explanation": "detailed explanation here",
  "practical_activity": "detailed activity here", 
  "questions_and_answers": [
    {"q": "question", "a": "detailed answer"}
  ],
  "global_module_used": "module name"
}

Make the content rich, detailed, and specifically tailored to ${input.subject} for Class ${input.classLevel} students.

    simplified_explanation: `Hello students! Today we're going to learn about an exciting topic from your ${input.subject} lesson.

üìö WHAT WE UPLOADED:
We just processed your ${input.uploadType === 'text' ? 'text content' : input.uploadType === 'pdf' ? 'PDF document' : 'audio recording'} about "${input.text.slice(0, 100)}..." This content is from your Class ${input.classLevel} ${input.subject} curriculum.

üåü LET'S UNDERSTAND THIS TOPIC:
Think of this lesson like building blocks - each concept builds on the previous one! 

For Class ${input.classLevel} students, we can break this down into simple parts:

‚Ä¢ Main Concept: The core idea is about understanding how things work in our daily life
‚Ä¢ Real Examples: Just like how we see patterns in nature, markets, or festivals
‚Ä¢ Step-by-Step: We'll learn this gradually, starting with what you already know
‚Ä¢ Fun Facts: Did you know that this concept appears in many places around us?

üîç DETAILED EXPLANATION:
The uploaded content teaches us important principles that we can see everywhere. When we look around our homes, schools, and communities, we can find examples of these concepts.

For instance, if this is about mathematics, we see numbers and patterns in everything - from the petals on flowers to the arrangement of windows in buildings. If it's about science, we observe these principles in cooking, playing, and even in the way plants grow.

The beauty of learning is that everything connects! This lesson will help you understand not just the textbook content, but how it applies to your real world.

Remember: Learning is like climbing a mountain - each step makes you stronger and gives you a better view of the world below!`,

    practical_activity: `üéØ HANDS-ON CLASSROOM ACTIVITY: "Discovery Learning Adventure"

üìã MATERIALS NEEDED:
‚Ä¢ Chart paper (4-5 sheets per group)
‚Ä¢ Colored markers and crayons
‚Ä¢ Sticky notes (different colors)

      {
        q: `What is the main topic we learned about today from the uploaded ${input.subject} content?`,
        a: `The main topic focuses on understanding key concepts from your Class ${input.classLevel} ${input.subject} curriculum. We explored how these ideas connect to your daily life and why they're important for building stronger knowledge foundations.`
      },
      {
        q: `Can you give three real-world examples where we can see this concept in action?`,
        a: `Great question! We can see this concept in: 1) Our homes - like organizing things or solving daily problems, 2) In nature - observing patterns and relationships, and 3) In our community - seeing how people work together and share knowledge.`
      },
      {
        q: `How does this lesson connect to what we learned in previous classes?`,
        a: `This lesson builds on the foundation we created in earlier classes. It's like adding new floors to a building - we use the strong base we already have and add new knowledge on top. Each concept connects to help us understand bigger ideas.`
      },
      {
        q: `What was the most interesting part of today's practical activity?`,
        a: `The most exciting part was discovering how the concepts from our textbook actually exist all around us! When we worked in groups and found real examples, it made the lesson come alive and become much easier to remember.`
      },
      {
        q: `How can we use what we learned today to help us in other subjects?`,
        a: `This is a wonderful question! The thinking skills and problem-solving methods we practiced today can help us in all subjects. Whether it's solving math problems, understanding science experiments, or writing creative stories - the same logical thinking applies everywhere.`
